# A short list of recommended reading to get you started

## Elastinen teoria (maamekaniikkaa varten):
For the more mathematically minded: Landau & Lifshitz: Theory of Elasticity (no need to read to the end)
For linear thermoelastic theory: Sokolnikoff: Mathematical Theory of Elasticity ([https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.476142/page/n7/mode/2up])

## Hydrology:
For me it was nice to freshen up my hydrodynamics first (Landau & Lifshitz has a book for that too), but that is technically not necessary.

## Frozen ground:

One promising book I didn't have access to is [https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/abs/frozen-earth/mechanics-of-frozen-ground/FCA5A4568ED967D690056D1632C402A7]
